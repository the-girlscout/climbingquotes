"Here's the thing. You'd like to talk about yourself and what swell stuff you've climbed lately. Well, who wouldn't? As it turns out, we have a format in which that sort of spray is acceptable. It's called a TR. In a TR, every other word can be 'I' and the words in between can be numbers representing how rad you are, though it's a time-honored tradition to throw in a few sentences about how afraid you were that you *weren't* going to [insert heroic deed here] before getting to the part about how you do.<BR>Your trouble is that you're trying to disguise your spray as RFIs or attempts at actual human conversation and no one is fooled. It is quite possible to say '<I>Now that I climb outside so often I find that I absolutely suck at gym climbing and since I'm having a miserable time there, what with everyone snickering at me and falling off of things I think I should be able to do, I'm asking myself why I spend the money on a gym membership when I can go to rec.climbing and get snickered at for free</I>' without mentioning a single number." <CITE>&mdash;Dawn Alguard.</CITE>

"Nevertheless, it's worth hanging on in here to catch the meaningful discussions we occasionally have about stoves, pies, the importance of failure and keeping a stiff upper lip and why no-one posts here any more. Once in a while some headstrong fool posts about climbing they've done, and we all seek to reassure ourselves that what they did wasn't that hard really, we would have done it ourselves if we hadn't (or had) been old, infirm and unfit and if we did it once ourselves many years ago it was probably a mistake and we should seek to discourage others from doing the same." <CITE>&mdash;Tony Buckley on uk.rec.climbing.</CITE>

"Routes rate me, not the other way around." <CITE>&mdash;Andy Cairns.</CITE>


"The whole idea of comparing climbers is ludicrous... It would be like sitting Van Gogh down with Rembrandt and saying: 'Ready, get set, go'." <CITE>&mdash;Pat Ament.</CITE>


"In fact, I think you should add your body fat to the rating of the climb, to get a true measure of your inner climber. So climbing a 5.7 with 22% body fat is way harder than climbing a 5.14 with 3% body fat." <CITE>&mdash;Mike Yukish.</CITE>


"The Puking Gecko, Grand Wall, *** S9 5.12d/e 712m<BR>An intimidating and salacious climb. The final pitch is so exposed, tricky, and continuously strenuous that it is impossible to even contact the rock at any point. Better than making passionate love on top of a Japanese Bullet Train. Superbly magnificent and grimly brilliant." <CITE>&mdash;Andy Cairns.</CITE>


"Anyone need advice on making the transition from 5.12 to 5.11?" <CITE>&mdash;Andy Cairns.</CITE>


"I like people who are good because they've tried hard. People like Dave Graham are annoying because they're so good and haven't even had to try. Dave did 8b+ in his first year of climbing!" <CITE>&mdash;Danny Cattell.</CITE>


"I did get upset once, when we were hiking between pitches 15 and 16. Two women and a dog were trying to find their way down through the maze of trails below the First Summit and they asked us: '<I>Are you on the trail?</I>' I let my indignity show: '<I>NO, we're on a CLIMB!</I>'" <CITE>&mdash;Andy Cairns.</CITE>

"To apply human standards of measurements to this monarch of mountains is sacrilege. To attempt by mere words and figures to convey some idea of its stupendous massiveness, its nobly-defiant impressive individuality, is rankest folly." <CITE>&mdash;Herbert Earl Wilson</A>, about El Cap, 1926.</CITE>


"It is a crest of granite... perfectly inaccessible, being probably the only one of the prominent points about the Yosemite which never has been, and never will be, trodden my human foot." <CITE>&mdash;California Geological Survey report about Half Dome, 1865.</CITE>


"It's so good and wonderful and so other-earth-other-sky transcendentally <I>different</I> in Yosemite that I could spend a dozen karmic cycles there and not exhaust the place." <CITE>&mdash;Mike Borghoff.</CITE>


"I couldn't catch a ball or any of that stuff. I could do only what required brute stupidity." <CITE>&mdash;Warren Harding</A> (1925&mdash;2002).</CITE>


"Screwing is more enjoyable than drilling bolt holes!." <CITE>&mdash;Warren Harding</A> (1925&mdash;2002).</CITE>


"I continued with whatever 'qualified climbers' I could con into this rather unpromising venture." <CITE>&mdash;Warren Harding</A> (1925&mdash;2002), about the Nose.</CITE>


"As I hammered in the last bolt and staggered over the rim, it was not at all clear to me who was the conqueror and who was the conquered. I do recall that El Cap seemed to be in much better condition than I was." <CITE>&mdash;Warren Harding</A> (1925&mdash;2002).</CITE>


"I was spent up. I sure grabbed that girl of mine." <CITE>&mdash;Warren Harding</A> (1925&mdash;2002), after summiting the Nose.</CITE>


"If mankind doesn't kill himself first (on a mountain or with a bomb) he may just learn how to inhabit the Earth as god planned." <CITE>&mdash;Editorial in News after the ascent of the Nose.</CITE>


"Our ascent, of course, does not end the possibility for new accomplishments on El Capitan. The day will probably come when this climb will be done in five days, perhaps less; and a younger generation will make a new route on the west face." <CITE>&mdash;Royal Robbins</A>, after the 2<SUP>nd</SUP> ascent of the Nose, 1960 (the record is now about 4h17).</CITE>


"If the answer is 13 RURPs and a bat hook, what was the question?" <CITE>&mdash;Joel Wiley.</CITE>


"Actually, we're just glorified flagpole sitters." <CITE>&mdash;Warren Harding</A> (1925&mdash;2002).</CITE>

"The best part is getting to the top 'cause the pain's all over." <CITE>&mdash;Dan Osman</A>.</CITE>


"As we unloaded packs at the parking lot, two young ladies approached us to ask if we were THE Yosemite climbers... They asked if it were true that Yosemite climbers chafe their hands on the granite to enable them to friction up vertical walls. We assured them that the preposterous myth was true." <CITE>&mdash;Chuck Pratt, 1965.</CITE>


"The climbing as a whole is not very esthetic or enjoyable; it is merely difficult." <CITE>&mdash;Yvon Chouinard</A> (1963, on Yosemite).</CITE>


"Just why is Yosemite climbing so different? Why does it have techniques, ethics and equipment all of its own? The basic reason lies in the rock itself. Nowhere else in the world is the rock so exfoliated, so glacier-polished and so devoid of handholds. All of the climbing lines follow vertical crack systems. Every piton crack, every handhold is a vertical one. Special techniques and equipment have evolved through absolute necessity." <CITE>&mdash;Yvon Chouinard</A>, 1963.</CITE>


"I strode among giants, friends tell me now, though at the time I felt more like a misfit associating with oddballs." <CITE>&mdash;Steve Roper, Introduction to</CITE> Camp 4</A>.


"Many have questioned the quality of this sort of achievement, deploring the use of pitons, tension traverses and expansion bolts, but the record speaks for itself. This is a technical age and climbers will continue in the future to look for new routes. There is nothing more satisfying than being a pioneer." <CITE>&mdash;Allen Steck</A>, justifying the 1<SUP>st</SUP> ascent of Sentinel's north face, 1950.</CITE>


"Writing this last chapter has been difficult and painful. It involves do's and don'ts, obligations and responsibilities. Most climbers are individuals who love freedom &mdash; they climb because it makes them feel free. We may expect then, that having others suggest how they ought to climb will rub wrong. There used to be so few climbers that it didn't matter where one drove a piton, there wasn't a worry about demolishing the rock. Now things are different. There are so many of us, and there will be more. <I>A simple equation exists between freedom and numbers: the more people the less freedom.</I> If we are to retain the beauties of the sport, the fine edge, the challenge, we must consider our style of climbing; and if we are not to mutilate and destroy the routes, we must eliminate the heavy handed use of pitons and bolts." <CITE>&mdash;Royal Robbins</A></CITE>, Basic Rockcraft, 1971.


"I had the unique experience the next day: placing sixteen bolts in a row. It was just blank and there was no way around. But it was a route worth bolting for, and after a time I began to take an almost perverse joy in it, or at least in doing a good job." <CITE>&mdash;Royal Robbins</A></CITE>, Tis-sa-ack ascent, 1970.


"He liked to play chess and do intelligent things, and I was a serious drinker and nonthinker." <CITE>&mdash;Warren Harding about Royal Robbins.</CITE>


"To practice for the Steck-Salath&eacute;, crawl across asphalt parking lots in the summer, on your knees and elbows." <CITE>&mdash;Dingus Milktoast.</CITE>


"My next climb is going to be a tourist troll in a wheelchair." <CITE>&mdash;Allen Steck</A> to John Salath&eacute; during the 1<SUP>st</SUP> ascent of the north face of Sentinel Rock.</CITE>


"Oh, shit!" <CITE>&mdash;Jim Madsen when he rappelled off the end of his rope on El Cap's Dihedral Wall in 1968.</CITE> 


"Goddamn it! His parka doesn't fit me!" <CITE>&mdash;Steve Roper</A>, after reaching the body of Irving Smith in the Lost Arrow Chimney.</CITE>


"I wouldn't go there if I were you. They steal from the store and they smell and they wear rags and even piss right outside their tents. I tell you, it's like a leper colony, that place." <CITE>&mdash;Yosemite Lodge bellman trying to dissuade a girl from visiting Camp 4, 1962.</CITE>


"Climbers have no sense of smell." <CITE>&mdash;Conrad Anker</A>'s mother.</CITE>


"John Wayne never wore Lycra." <CITE>&mdash;Ron Kauk</A> about why he climbs in Blue-Jeans.</CITE>


"At either end of the social spectrum there lies a leisure class." <CITE>&mdash;Eric Beck.</CITE>


"I became so desperate that I considered throwing Eric [Beck] off the ledge. I thought I could get down and then lie about what had happened. To my addled brain, this was plausible. Then I came to my senses and woke Eric up and told him that either he had to retreat or I'd throw him off. We went down and I never climbed again for a quarter of a century." <CITE>&mdash;Dave Cook about a new route on the Sentinel.</CITE>


"There was a climber named Bridwell<BR>On grade I's he did well.<BR>But on grade VI, he got into a fix<BR>and rappelled to the talus and hid well." <CITE>&mdash;Eric Beck.</CITE>


"It is better to retreat off a good climb than to succeed on an indifferent one." <CITE>&mdash;Chris Jones, 1971.</CITE>


"Excluding Royal Robbins</A> (who is in a brilliant class all by himself, a Stirling Moss, an index of perfection) Valley climbers are brooding misfits who know only too well what awaits them down in the San Joaquin Valley and beyond." <CITE>&mdash;Mike Borghoff.</CITE>


"He was skinning a bear. I was terrified at first, because the corpse resembled a naked man quartered between two trees. He'd created a deadfall trap over some big talus blocks and the bear had fallen in. He used the skin for something and jerked the meat. If it wasn't astonishing enough behavior in a national park, the next day he made donuts, using bear fat for grease! Surely, by now, he's created an empire somewhere in the world..." <CITE>&mdash;Dave Cook.</CITE>


"In light of the rising frequency of human/grizzly bear conflicts, the Department of Fish and Game is advising hikers, hunters, and fishermen to take extra precautions and keep alert for bears while in the field. We advise that outdoors men wear noisy little bells on their clothing so as not to startle bears that aren't expecting them. We also advise outdoors men to carry pepper spray with them in case of an encounter with a bear. It is also a good idea to watch out for fresh signs of bear activity. Outdoors men should recognize the difference between black bear and grizzly bear droppings. Black bear droppings are smaller and contain lots of berries and squirrel fur. Grizzly bear droppings have little bells in them and smell like pepper." <CITE>&mdash;Grizzly bear notice.</CITE>


"I so much enjoy waking up to garbage truck '<I>back up</I>' beepers in the morning at Yosemite. It makes me feel like I'm in New York city!" <CITE>&mdash;athayer999.</CITE>


"My once-keen analytical mind has become so dulled by endless hours of baking in the hot sun, thrashing about in tight chimneys, pulling at impossibly heavy loads, freezing my ass off.... so that now my mental state is comparable to that of a Peruvian Indian, well stoked on coca leaves..." <CITE>&mdash;Warren Harding</A> (1925&mdash;2002)</CITE>, Reflections on a broken down climber.


"Here I was working away and always this mumbling and bitching from below, and finally the shocking ejaculation '<I>This is a lot of shit</I>'. From then on I felt I was battling two opponents, the wall and Peterson." <CITE>&mdash;Royal Robbins</A></CITE>, Tis-sa-ack.


"I was once bouldering in solitude in the Needles, when a young female walked up and introduced herself and asked who I was. I told her and continued bouldering. She turned and walked away after a few minutes, saying over her shoulder: '<I>you can't be John Gill. He climbs much better than that</I>'." <CITE>&mdash;John Gill</CITE>, Master of rock by Pat Ament</A>.


"I've tried many sports, but climbing is the best. The beauty of this sport is that no matter how good you get, you can always find a way to challenge yourself." <CITE>&mdash;Randy Leavitt</A>.</CITE>


"Gee, in the old days people used aid to make things easier, nowadays they use aid to make things harder." <CITE>&mdash;Juanita Donini.</CITE>


"I'm an expert at torturing people on different levels of the Yosemite Crack Circuit. The key to torture is don't kill the victim all at once!" <CITE>&mdash;Karl Baba.</CITE>


"It lasted but a year of two, till all the routes were done. The pace so fast that most forgot that climbing could be fun." <CITE>&mdash;John Sherman</A>.</CITE>


"The future of Yosemite climbing lies not in Yosemite, but in using the new techniques in the great granite ranges of the world." <CITE>&mdash;Yvon Chouinard</A>, 1963.</CITE>


"Personally, I would rather climb in the high mountains. I have always abhorred the tremendous heat, the dirt-filled cracks, the ant-covered foul-smelling trees and bushes which cover the cliffs, the filth and noise of Camp 4 (the climbers' campground), and worst of all, the multitudes of tourists which abound during the weekends and summer months." <CITE>&mdash;Yvon Chouinard</A>, 1961.</CITE>


"Climbing for speed records will probably become more popular, a mania which has just begun. Climbers climb not just to see how fast and efficiently they can do it, but far worse, to see how much faster and more efficiently they are than a party which did the same climb a few days before. The climb becomes secondary, no more important than a racetrack. Man is pitted against man." <CITE>&mdash;Yvon Chouinard</A>.</CITE>


"Every time I go out and do something, Hans panics and starts trying to beat me. He's like a dog humping your leg." <CITE>&mdash;Dean Potter.</CITE>


"Vy can't ve chust climb!" <CITE>&mdash;John Salath&eacute;.</CITE>


"<B>Boulder</B> /n./ place close to the ground to practice falling. When climbers aren't climbing, they like to sharpen their skills by bouldering on large rocks located in places frequented by impressionable tourists. Because bouldering is done without protection, the rule is never to climb higher than you'd like to fall. That is why so many climbers stand around discussing boulder problems instead of climbing them."

"The first question which you will ask and which I must try to answer is this, '<I>What is the use of climbing Mount Everest?</I>' and my answer must at once be, '<I>It is no use</I>'.<BR>There is not the slightest prospect of any gain whatsoever. Oh, we may learn a little about the behavior of the human body at high altitudes, and possibly medical men may turn our observation to some account for the purposes of aviation. But otherwise nothing will come of it. We shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver, not a gem, nor any coal or iron. We shall not find a single foot of earth that can be planted with crops to raise food. It's no use.<BR>So, if you cannot understand that there is something in man which responds to the challenge of this mountain and goes out to meet it, that the struggle is the struggle of life itself upward and forever upward, then you won't see why we go.

"It seemed as though our first view of the Himalaya was to be indefinitely postponed. Again the great cloud screen rose tall above the curve of the world.

The idea of climbing over such delicate and distant tips, the very desire of it, never entered my heart or head.

"Every time significant tools have been developed in alpinism, making the extant cutting-edge climbs into mainstream classics, there have been those who have decried the developments, claiming that such tools take the adventure out of the sport. Other individuals, with perhaps more vision or imagination, or perhaps just a greater need for the new tools, have taken the tools, developed skills and techniques beyond the old school, and opened up whole new worlds of the possible.<BR>To which of these two camps of thought belongs the greater sense of adventure?

"So if you're gonna argue about bolts on crags, dump the elitist attitude.

"Artificial aids have never been popular with us. If a climber does not feel safe in descending, he ought to practice on rock which he can climb, not spoil rock which he cannot with blacksmith's leavings.<BR>Pegs should never be left as memorials.<BR>When fixed irons are placed with fixed ropes attached, as on the Matterhorn or the Dent du Geant, they spoil the climber and the climbing alike. They attract feckless folks on to the peaks, and torment them with the rock-barrages of pantechnicon parties or the stonier sharp-shooting of daft solitary scramblers." <CITE>&mdash;Geoffrey Winthrop Young</A>,</CITE> Mountain Craft, 1921.


"If the climbing of Everest is, as we've been told, an important stage in the victory of mind over matter, then let every conceivable method be adopted to ensure success. Let dynamite be taken to excavate a better platform for the tents at the highest camps; let the climbers be in sufficient numbers to be always at hand to help an exhausted man; let pitons be taken, cables fixed, and oxygen dumped at various points. It is by these mechanical inventions that the superstitious terrors of the natives will be destroyed, far more than by sacrifice of life or health. And let everything possible be done to facilitate the ascent of future parties; otherwise there will be an appearance of withholding from others the benefits that an ascent of Everest confers." <CITE>&mdash;RLG Irving.</CITE>


"Nothing illustrates the basic irrationality of climbers better than the code that says you don't leave good equipment behind. Rappel points are set up with the very pitons and sling rope that you consider too cheap and unsafe for climbing. To use expensive equipment for this is deemed an ostentatious display of wealth, a cowardly act or inexcusably bad planning." <CITE>&mdash;Nick Clinch</A>.</CITE>

"I just bought a complete set of climbing gear on ebay; it comes with a lifetime warranty..."


"You should replace your harness for a variety of reasons as they occur. One reason would be upon your tenth redpoint failure due to the gear loop arrangement being 'crappy', the leg loops being 'too stiff' or the harness having an ugly color pattern that 'just threw me off'. Another occasion for harness replacement is if a climber is stricken with Dulap's Disease (hypertrophy of the fat lining of the abdomen). Usually a larger harness size clears up this problem, but new/prettier colors can also help alleviate symptoms. Otherwise, replace when it starts looking like your underwear (holes, worn spots, faint smell of cabbage)." <CITE>&mdash;Tim Stich.</CITE>


"Dave! This sling is still good. Look! It's still got some colour!" <CITE>&mdash;The Andrew Barry rappel sling test.</CITE>

"Bolts... I never felt right drilling 'em, but I never felt bad clippin' em." <CITE>&mdash;Karl Baba.</CITE>


"Progress in technique, training and equipment had made the climber too efficient; as in many other fields, technique was in the process of killing adventure. For those who sought to define their own nature, in the combat of man against the mountain, there would soon be no solution but the desperate ways of the solo climber and the winter mountaineer." <CITE>&mdash;Lionel Terray</A>.</CITE>


"&mdash; What way do most people find works best for racking tri-cams?<BR>&mdash; Rack the pink one on its own biner, rack all the rest together on a single biner.

"It has become popular in other parts of North America, especially in the Northwest, to lay fixed ropes up a climb to avoid having to bivouac or take a chance with the weather. These ropes create an umbilical cord from man to where he truly belongs and to where he can quickly retreat if things get tough. This manifests American love of security and shows that the climber should not be there in the first place." <CITE>&mdash;Yvon Chouinard</A>.</CITE>


"The gear or practices that we argue about are rarely the real cause of accidents. More dangerous are inattention, fatigue, ego, and bad karma." <CITE>&mdash;Karl Baba.</CITE>

"Man, I thought you always carry your grigri and a backup grigri on those trad climbs?

"At the gym they teach this convoluted belay technique where you always keep your hand on the rope." <CITE>&mdash;Overheard at Williamson (SoCal) by Jay Tanzman.</CITE>


"You have to train your ropes better. Ropes are like dogs. Think consistent reinforcement of good behavior. New ropes need a lot of work. My rope is usually well behaved. However, Emily's rope is always getting itself tied up in knots. I think she neglected it when it was young." <CITE>&mdash;Sue Hopkins.</CITE>


"When men climb on a great mountain together, the rope between them is more than a mere physical aid to the ascent; it is a symbol of the spirit of the enterprise. It is a symbol of men banded together in a common effort of will and strength against their own true enemies: inertia, cowardice, greed, ignorance and all weaknesses of the spirit."


"A whirlwind of snapshots of my climbs with Alex:<BR>'Yes, this is perfectly normal.'&mdash;After getting one rap rope stuck above and one stuck below us on Solar Slab in Red Rocks as it started snowing and getting dark.<BR>'Thank god, you don't know enough about climbing yet to be scared.'&mdash;When we had to do a 60-foot unprotectable traverse on a layer of moss and dead pine needles in complete darkness in attempt to find the least dead rap tree in Looking Glass, North Carolina.<BR>'Yes, it is 8 am and we are going to do a 1 pitch climb, but bring your headlamp just in case.'&mdash;I have needed it every single time we have climbed together. I learned my lesson after the above experience.<BR>'You'll thank me later.'&mdash;After somehow turning an easy 1-pitch climb into at least 6 in Oklahoma.<BR>'I want to make sure you get your moneys worth.'&mdash;By giving me the pleasure of bushwhacking the most difficult way to the base of every single climb.<BR>The slideshow goes on and on and on. I was suddenly horrified. Who have I been climbing with and what 'bad habits' have I been taught? Other than how to wear my helmet at a jaunty angle." <CITE>&mdash;Cara.</CITE>
